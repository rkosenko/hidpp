 * Get or divert mouse button events

 * MouseButtonSpy can send events with raw button
 * events indepedant of any remapping or profile
 * settings.
 *
 * The event reports 16 buttons state as bits in
 * a uint16_t value.
 *
 * Button can be remapped or disabled for standard
 * HID reports but it does not affect how they are
 * reported in MouseButtonSpy event.
 *
 * If an on-board profile is used, the remapping does
 * not apply. For using the remapping from this feature,
 * on-board profiles must be disabled by setting HostMode
 * in the OnboardProfiles feature.
 *
 * Button mapping is reset with the mouse.
